## Features

### 1. Responsive
The page is completely responsive across all devices, different screen sizes and viewports.

To ensure that the webpage adapts to all device screen sizes I have used,
- Fluid grid design.
- Media queries in the CSS code.
- JavaScript to automatically adjust the max width of the landing page across different displays according to its available width.
- Font size and scale transformations to fit within the device width.

To check the responsiveness of the page follow the below steps:
#### Step 1: Inspect element
**Right click** on the webpage and click on **Inspect**.

Or you can use the following keyboard commands:

- Mac: **âŒ˜ + Shift + C**
- Windows/Linux: **F12** or **Ctrl + Shift + C** or **Ctrl + Shift + I**

![Inspect Element](https://nand-sara.github.io/nsara_project_2/assets/documentation/inspect.png "Inspect Element")
*Drop down menu on Right Clicking the page*

#### Step 2: Check Responsiveness
Toggle between devices by clicking on the *Toggle device toolbar* icon on the top left corner of the dev panel.

Or you can use the keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl + Shift + M**

Click on the dropdown menu and select **Responsive** for checking the responsiveness of the page in different screen widths.

### 2. Browser Compatible

### 3. Easy Navigation

The navigation is set to be fixed at the top of the webpage so that it can be easily accessible. The top navbar is hidden on scrolling down and reappears on scrolling up. The links to each section of the page are also available in the footer section of the page.
